### Search for recipes using keywords

*[Live Demo - Recipe-App](https://swapnil031.github.io/recipe-app/)*

This is a web-app developed in ReactJS which allows searching for delicious recipes using keywords. It also shows an interesting food-fact everytime we refresh the page.

Here, the concept of `router` in React is used to setup routing for the app. The app `fetch` data from a food API and renders it in a responsive frontend using bootstrap framework.
