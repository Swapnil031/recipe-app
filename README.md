## Recipe World | Search for recipes

This is a web-app developed in ReactJS which allows searching for delicious recipes using keywords. It also shows an interesting food-fact everytime we refresh the page.

Here, the concept of Router in React is used to setup routing for the app. The app fetches data from a food API and renders in beautiful-responsive frontend using bootstrap framework.
