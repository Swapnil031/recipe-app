## Recipe World | Search for recipes

<u><a href="https://swapnil031.github.io/recipe-app/">Live Demo - Recipe-App</a></u>

This is a web-app developed in ReactJS which allows searching for delicious recipes using keywords. It also shows an interesting food-fact everytime we refresh the page.

Here, the concept of Routers in React is used to setup routing for the app. The app fetches data from a food API and renders it in a responsive frontend using bootstrap framework.
